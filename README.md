cycles.cpp implements a Fisher market–based algorithm for computing EF1 (Envy-Free up to One Good) and Pareto-Optimal allocations in ring multigraphs. The valuation matrix is generated randomly. To guide the algorithm, we use a structured price initialization: prices are initialized using powers of a large enough constant $L$. Goods on the first multiedge have prices of the order $L^0$, next have prices of order $L$, then $L^2$, and so on. Although the algorithm has pseudo-polynomial theoretical runtime, it performs very efficiently in practice.
